To use the bot you have to install docker on a machine (preferably with a big GPU), install docker gpu and everything that is needed for docker to use the GPU.
Change in 'matrixbot.py' line 95 to your credentials for a matrix instance and a user created for the bot.

The bot can be used with different models and you can change the prompt temperature and prompt length via commands.
